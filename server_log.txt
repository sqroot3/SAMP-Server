[23:08:04] [chat] [Odeim]:  big if true
[23:08:05] [chat] [rally3]: just testing regular shit
[23:08:12] [chat] [rally3]: not necessarily lsrcr related lul
[23:08:18] [chat] [rally3]: just will try out my personal shit here
[23:08:23] [chat] [rally3]: some of it may go to lsrcr
[23:08:25] [chat] [rally3]: some of it may not
[23:08:38] [chat] [Odeim]: its your server
[23:08:43] [chat] [Odeim]: you do whatever u want
[23:08:49] [chat] [rally3]: and its ~$5 per month as it is
[23:09:08] [chat] [Odeim]: man i miss these
[23:09:15] [chat] [rally3]: per year is 60 bucks
[23:09:21] [chat] [rally3]: which is more than affordable
[23:09:27] [chat] [rally3]: but it has the 20 player cap
[23:09:32] [chat] [Odeim]:  yeah well 
[23:09:34] [chat] [Odeim]: 5 dollars
[23:09:34] [chat] [rally3]: that can be upgraded tho
[23:09:39] [chat] [Odeim]: per month is good
[23:09:43] [chat] [rally3]: ye
[23:09:47] [chat] [rally3]: besides im just trying out this month so far
[23:09:55] [chat] [rally3]: main concern is the design
[23:10:06] [chat] [Odeim]: so the first thing u gonna do
[23:10:07] [chat] [Odeim]: is what
[23:10:17] [chat] [rally3]: i'll try to do some implementation of the roof aim thingy
[23:10:29] [chat] [Odeim]:  oh cool
[23:10:43] [chat] [rally3]: first i gotta figure out how to pass my gamemode to it tho
[23:10:47] [chat] [rally3]: its not a vps
[23:10:50] [chat] [rally3]: but a gameserver
[23:10:54] [chat] [rally3]: vps' are bloated
[23:11:20] [chat] [Odeim]:  someone tried to abuse vps before
[23:11:24] [chat] [Odeim]: by purchasing a server
[23:11:27] [chat] [Odeim]: for store
[23:11:30] [chat] [rally3]: x d 
[23:11:30] [chat] [Odeim]: storage
[23:11:38] [chat] [rally3]: u can use that though
[23:11:43] [chat] [rally3]: they have rules on what can and cannot be 
[23:11:44] [chat] [Odeim]: he abused it
[23:11:49] [chat] [Odeim]: so he can make more money
[23:11:49] [chat] [rally3]: wym
[23:11:54] [chat] [rally3]: oh like a sales platform or sth
[23:11:57] [chat] [Odeim]:  yeah
[23:11:59] [chat] [rally3]: ye thats strictly against use lmao
[23:12:05] [chat] [Odeim]:  i told him its fraud
[23:12:05] [chat] [rally3]: lets pistol duel
[23:12:07] [chat] [Odeim]: but he said
[23:12:09] [chat] [Odeim]: idc

[23:13:06] [chat] [Odeim]:  wait what

[23:13:14] [chat] [Odeim]: feelsbadman

[23:13:20] [chat] [rally3]: they set up
[23:13:29] [chat] [Odeim]:  wait they set this up
[23:13:30] [chat] [Odeim]: before
[23:13:33] [chat] [Odeim]: u purchase it
[23:13:34] [chat] [Odeim]: niice
[23:13:35] [chat] [rally3]: ye the gameserver
[23:13:37] [chat] [rally3]: resp.
[23:13:42] [chat] [rally3]: CAN GO CAPS IN HEREEE
[23:13:49] [chat] [Odeim]: WOOOOHOOO

[23:14:07] [chat] [rally3]:  x d
[23:14:13] [chat] [rally3]: man the map is so serene
[23:14:19] [chat] [rally3]: without all the shitty bloat on top of it
[23:14:28] [chat] [Odeim]: it feels
[23:14:32] [chat] [Odeim]: kinda better
[23:14:33] [chat] [Odeim]: for me
[23:14:36] [chat] [rally3]: ye
[23:14:39] [chat] [Odeim]: to play on this server lmao
[23:14:44] [chat] [rally3]: well obv some things would need to be changed a bit
[23:14:46] [chat] [Odeim]: without bases
[23:14:49] [chat] [rally3]: as far as the map goes
[23:14:49] [chat] [Odeim]: i mean
[23:14:51] [chat] [rally3]: like vehs, etc
[23:14:58] [chat] [rally3]: but it wouldn't be something subject to user change
[23:15:01] [chat] [rally3]: i can promise u that
[23:15:11] [chat] [Odeim]: man isnt this
[23:15:13] [chat] [Odeim]: isis base
[23:15:16] [chat] [rally3]: yes
[23:15:19] [chat] [rally3]: look at it
[23:15:19] [chat] [Odeim]: i forgot this place
[23:15:21] [chat] [rally3]: so peaceful
[23:15:30] [chat] [Odeim]:  and holy fuck he took 
[23:15:35] [chat] [Odeim]: the whole area 
[23:15:37] [chat] [Odeim]: for his base
[23:15:37] [chat] [rally3]: yep
[23:15:43] [chat] [rally3]: why? cause of an overkill of donations
[23:15:45] [chat] [Odeim]: and its nothing compared to these building
[23:15:49] [chat] [rally3]: and why? cause of an overkill of services
[23:15:55] [chat] [rally3]: legit 80 euros
[23:16:05] [chat] [rally3]: i spent 5 only for the server, and its not a 200 cap
[23:16:07] [chat] [Odeim]: energ makes money
[23:16:11] [chat] [rally3]: but atm, a 100 cap makes sense
[23:16:16] [chat] [Odeim]: more than anyone here lmao
[23:16:16] [chat] [rally3]: so thats a reduction
[23:16:24] [chat] [rally3]: also, the hosted tab
[23:16:27] [chat] [rally3]: isnt necessary
[23:16:30] [chat] [rally3]: just an extra expense
[23:16:53] [chat] [rally3]: and teamspeak too
[23:16:56] [chat] [rally3]: holy shit xd
[23:16:59] [chat] [rally3]: but apparently
[23:17:00] [chat] [Odeim]: teamspeak is useless tbh
[23:17:04] [chat] [Odeim]: i am serious
[23:17:04] [chat] [rally3]: they run everything from the same vps
[23:17:13] [chat] [Odeim]: who uses ts these days
[23:17:13] [chat] [rally3]: thats why they have such an overhaul server and cost
[23:17:20] [chat] [rally3]: apparently
[23:17:23] [chat] [Odeim]: delete ts server
[23:17:31] [chat] [rally3]: resp
[23:17:32] [chat] [Odeim]: it will cost like 60 euros
[23:17:35] [chat] [Odeim]: per month
[23:17:39] [chat] [Odeim]: what else is useless
[23:17:44] [chat] [rally3]: 200 player cap
[23:17:46] [chat] [rally3]: hosted tab
[23:17:47] [chat] [Odeim]: ^^
[23:17:50] [chat] [rally3]: hosted tab is a huge one
[23:17:56] [chat] [Odeim]: probably down to 40 dollars
[23:18:05] [chat] [Odeim]: i mean
[23:18:06] [chat] [Odeim]: euros
[23:18:09] [chat] [rally3]: ye
[23:18:12] [chat] [rally3]: but my point is
[23:18:16] [chat] [rally3]: even like this, just 20 players
[23:18:22] [chat] [rally3]: its a $5 euro base line
[23:18:27] [chat] [rally3]: its a $5* base lien
[23:18:31] [chat] [rally3]: yes its only 20 players
[23:18:36] [chat] [rally3]: so not really enjoyable
[23:18:42] [chat] [rally3]: but we're on 60 at max these days
[23:18:54] [chat] [rally3]: i havent seen a point of 100 players 
[23:19:01] [chat] [rally3]: so a 100 cap would be another saving
[23:19:12] [chat] [Odeim]: idk but
[23:19:14] [chat] [rally3]: the website/forum is what's taking part of the other money
[23:19:17] [chat] [rally3]: but that's gotta be there
[23:19:17] [chat] [Odeim]: 100 cap is not usless
[23:19:23] [chat] [rally3]: 100 cap is fine
[23:19:25] [chat] [rally3]: they have 200 rn
[23:19:29] [chat] [Odeim]: wait what
[23:19:34] [chat] [Odeim]: lmao
[23:19:35] [chat] [Odeim]: they do
[23:19:36] [chat] [rally3]: at least 200 
[23:19:36] [chat] [Odeim]: wtf
[23:19:39] [chat] [rally3]: xd
[23:19:43] [chat] [Odeim]: didnt notice that
[23:19:47] [chat] [Odeim]: before it was 100
[23:19:49] [chat] [Odeim]: then 150
[23:19:58] [chat] [rally3]: i cant blame them honestly
[23:20:04] [chat] [rally3]: there were times when server count > 100
[23:20:14] [chat] [rally3]: but i'd say that need stopped being a necessity at least a year ago
[23:20:26] [chat] [Odeim]: because samp is dead..
[23:20:27] [chat] [Odeim]: or dying
[23:20:37] [chat] [Odeim]: nobody plays it anymore
[23:20:38] [chat] [rally3]: still possible to have a server
[23:20:42] [chat] [rally3]: and have people play it
[23:21:01] [chat] [Odeim]: yeah like 12 yo kids
[23:21:07] [chat] [rally3]: we're playing aren't we
[23:21:10] [chat] [rally3]:  x d 
[23:21:25] [chat] [Odeim]: i honestly dont know why i am playing this game lmao
[23:21:29] [chat] [Odeim]: is it because
[23:21:34] [chat] [rally3]: nostalgia i guess
[23:21:45] [chat] [rally3]: i think here is where they put the luxury house nonsense
[23:21:47] [chat] [rally3]: right
[23:21:49] [chat] [rally3]: to the left?>
[23:22:00] [chat] [Odeim]: i forgot
[23:22:02] [chat] [Odeim]: lmao
[23:22:06] [chat] [Odeim]: yeah right here
[23:22:08] [chat] [rally3]: ye its gotta be this one
[23:22:12] [chat] [rally3]: man what a waste xd
[23:22:22] [chat] [Odeim]: they want the moneu
[23:22:36] [chat] [rally3]: i dont think its necessarily them wanting the money
[23:22:42] [chat] [rally3]: but i think its incompetence
[23:22:51] [chat] [Odeim]: but its not for them
[23:22:52] [chat] [rally3]: like having a ts server expense (even if it is used in a vps)
[23:22:54] [chat] [rally3]: like come on
[23:22:56] [chat] [Odeim]: u want something cool
[23:22:57] [chat] [Odeim]: buy it
[23:23:16] [chat] [rally3]: also u can see this gm has the same vehicle problem
[23:23:20] [chat] [rally3]: vehs everywhere
[23:23:24] [chat] [rally3]: very high vehicle density
[23:23:29] [chat] [Odeim]: yeah
[23:23:32] [chat] [Odeim]: u want to limit it
[23:23:36] [chat] [rally3]: ye
[23:23:39] [chat] [rally3]: severely
[23:23:39] [chat] [Odeim]: so people
[23:23:44] [chat] [rally3]: u gotta buy ur own car
[23:23:45] [chat] [Odeim]: will use taxi driver class
[23:23:52] [chat] [rally3]: im not even considering a taxi class atm
[23:23:59] [chat] [rally3]: just the basic gameplay
[23:24:01] [chat] [Odeim]: and also
[23:24:03] [chat] [rally3]: whats an incentive
[23:24:04] [chat] [Odeim]: go to pizza
[23:24:05] [chat] [rally3]: having ur own car
[23:24:09] [chat] [rally3]: being able to tune it etc
[23:24:10] [chat] [Odeim]: u see we got bikes right?
[23:24:14] [chat] [Odeim]: there
[23:24:20] [chat] [Odeim]: and we can drive it
[23:24:23] [chat] [rally3]: ye the food distro nonsense
[23:24:23] [chat] [Odeim]: buuuuuuuuuuut
[23:24:25] [chat] [rally3]: xd
[23:24:31] [chat] [Odeim]: we have the food class
[23:24:38] [chat] [Odeim]: so this is stupid right
[23:24:40] [chat] [rally3]: also something i plan on heavily implementing no matter what
[23:24:43] [chat] [Odeim]: these bikes 
[23:24:45] [chat] [rally3]: is a modeled economy
[23:24:48] [chat] [Odeim]: should be for them
[23:24:48] [chat] [rally3]: taxes, etc
[23:24:52] [chat] [Odeim]: taxes?
[23:24:57] [chat] [Odeim]: i see what u doing 
[23:24:57] [chat] [rally3]: and government buildings generating revenue
[23:25:07] [chat] [rally3]: player businesses generating revenue
[23:25:07] [chat] [rally3]: etc
[23:25:09] [chat] [Odeim]: u want it to be like crazybob server
[23:25:14] [chat] [rally3]: oh jesus no
[23:25:14] [chat] [Odeim]: with taxes n shit
[23:25:20] [chat] [rally3]: thats a blatant rip off of SACNR
[23:25:22] [chat] [rally3]: no thanks
[23:25:29] [chat] [Odeim]: i mean its stupid
[23:25:33] [chat] [Odeim]: for me to earn 300mil
[23:25:42] [chat] [Odeim]: and then i have to pay 10mil for taxes
[23:25:50] [chat] [rally3]: nono it wouldn't be autistic like that
[23:25:56] [chat] [rally3]: needs thought obviously but
[23:26:02] [chat] [rally3]: idea is it would give money more value
[23:26:06] [chat] [rally3]: together with cars, etc
[23:26:22] [chat] [Odeim]: we are going to give it more value by adding stuff to houses
[23:26:28] [chat] [Odeim]: uhhh wait
[23:26:31] [chat] [Odeim]: got an idea
[23:26:35] [chat] [rally3]: go head
[23:26:35] [chat] [Odeim]: u purchase cars like
[23:26:40] [chat] [Odeim]: right*?
[23:26:45] [chat] [rally3]: yes
[23:26:50] [chat] [Odeim]: how about u able to customize them
[23:26:52] [chat] [rally3]: man i miss this
[23:26:53] [chat] [rally3]: ye 
[23:26:57] [chat] [rally3]: thats something i had planned too
[23:26:59] [chat] [Odeim]: HOLY FUCK
[23:27:00] [chat] [rally3]: able to save ur tuning
[23:27:02] [chat] [Odeim]: MAN THIS PLACE
[23:27:13] [chat] [Odeim]: i forgot about it
[23:27:17] [chat] [rally3]: yep
[23:27:30] [chat] [Odeim]: ok this place
[23:27:33] [chat] [rally3]: i mean this is a natural truck depot anyway
[23:27:42] [chat] [Odeim]: so anyways
[23:27:46] [chat] [rally3]: ye go ahead
[23:27:49] [chat] [Odeim]: the idea is you buy stuff for your car
[23:27:53] [chat] [Odeim]: but they're expensive
[23:27:57] [chat] [Odeim]: like for example nitros
[23:28:02] [chat] [Odeim]: u want 10x nitros?
[23:28:06] [chat] [rally3]: ye any customizable, etc
[23:28:06] [chat] [Odeim]: buy it for 450k
[23:28:11] [chat] [Odeim]: and save it
[23:28:15] [chat] [rally3]: the # itself would be modelled as well
[23:28:25] [chat] [rally3]: so that there's no discrepancies between prices of shit
[23:28:44] [chat] [Odeim]: yeah thats idea number 1
[23:28:49] [chat] [Odeim]: what else
[23:28:54] [chat] [rally3]: well 
[23:29:04] [chat] [rally3]: player owned businesses and government owned businesses
[23:29:18] [chat] [rally3]: in other words have more of a clear involvement of what the city's govt is
[23:29:53] [chat] [rally3]: oh and on houses too
[23:29:54] [chat] [Odeim]: me no understand
[23:30:02] [chat] [rally3]: definitely not allow players to "pick" their spot for a house
[23:30:06] [chat] [Odeim]: by player owned businesses
[23:30:09] [chat] [rally3]: ok so
[23:30:16] [chat] [rally3]: its tied to the economy obv
[23:30:22] [chat] [rally3]: a way to have an investment
[23:30:26] [chat] [rally3]: people would go buy items there etc
[23:30:35] [chat] [rally3]: and can work some sidejobs for businesses
[23:30:49] [chat] [Odeim]: like delievering goods ?
[23:30:52] [chat] [Odeim]: for that bussiness?
[23:30:57] [chat] [rally3]: ye minimissions for that business
[23:31:11] [chat] [rally3]: the longer u work for that business, you may get some discounts, etc in their ietms
[23:31:30] [chat] [Odeim]: also
[23:31:41] [chat] [Odeim]: weapons should cost more in ammunation
[23:31:48] [chat] [rally3]: not just that 
[23:31:55] [chat] [rally3]: ammu is a govt issued weap provider
[23:32:00] [chat] [rally3]: so they are the ones with the "bigger" guns
[23:32:00] [chat] [Odeim]: yeah
[23:32:04] [chat] [rally3]: at a larger price
[23:32:10] [chat] [rally3]: independent (illegal) weapons dealers
[23:32:14] [chat] [rally3]: they carry smaller guns
[23:32:16] [chat] [rally3]: but at a cheaper price
[23:32:35] [chat] [Odeim]: yeah good idea
[23:32:38] [chat] [rally3]: thinking of possibly implementing something about them building the guns they sell
[23:32:41] [chat] [Odeim]: u dont buy m4 from a weapons dealer
[23:32:46] [chat] [Odeim]: u buy it from ammu
[23:32:54] [chat] [Odeim]: sawnoff shotguns does not exist in ammu
[23:32:56] [chat] [rally3]: but its gotta avoid being this thing of running from checkpoint A to checkpoint B
[23:33:04] [chat] [rally3]: oh
[23:33:05] [chat] [rally3]: btw
[23:33:13] [chat] [rally3]: dual weild weapons - disabled
[23:33:15] [chat] [rally3]: weild*
[23:33:19] [chat] [Odeim]: yeah
[23:33:20] [chat] [rally3]: yield*
[23:33:20] [chat] [Odeim]: i know
[23:33:21] [chat] [rally3]: jesus

[23:33:38] [chat] [Odeim]: u talking about ur server
[23:33:41] [chat] [rally3]: i think its wield
[23:33:43] [chat] [Odeim]: wield*
[23:33:43] [chat] [rally3]: yes
[23:33:49] [chat] [rally3]: gg engliush
[23:34:01] [chat] [Odeim]: u americano my bratha
[23:34:20] [chat] [rally3]: anyway the topics i have on my brainstorm so far are
[23:34:21] [chat] [Odeim]:  how cOmE u DoN't KnoW english
[23:34:33] [chat] [rally3]: business, rob, house, vehicles, chase, kill, death, money, jail, crime
[23:35:06] [chat] [Odeim]: pls prioritize houses
[23:35:11] [chat] [Odeim]: then chase
[23:35:15] [chat] [Odeim]: then bussiness
[23:35:18] [chat] [rally3]: chase as a gameplay element
[23:35:23] [chat] [rally3]: and all of these are just elements
[23:35:33] [chat] [rally3]: their order != priority, but they're all equally important
[23:35:36] [chat] [rally3]: for  the balance 
[23:35:50] [chat] [rally3]: also i should mention this is more of a long term project
[23:35:51] [chat] [Odeim]: u dont did not understand
[23:35:55] [chat] [Odeim]: we add those stuuf
[23:36:02] [chat] [Odeim]: like "slowly" for the players
[23:36:06] [chat] [Odeim]: so they adapt to each one
[23:36:12] [chat] [rally3]: ur still on about lsrcr
[23:36:14] [chat] [rally3]: lmao
[23:36:22] [chat] [rally3]: they can implement the changes they want
[23:36:22] [chat] [Odeim]:  WAIT WHAT
[23:36:26] [chat] [rally3]: i wont stop them from doing it
[23:36:32] [chat] [rally3]: besides i will actually keep sharing them
[23:36:32] [chat] [Odeim]: u talking about ur server
[23:36:34] [chat] [rally3]: yes
[23:36:37] [chat] [Odeim]: oh fuck

[23:36:47] [chat] [Odeim]: so u want to make your own server
[23:37:01] [chat] [rally3]: considering that lsrcr is beyond a complete repair
[23:37:04] [chat] [rally3]: its a good long term project
[23:37:14] [chat] [rally3]: an estimate rn i have of when some basis could be done
[23:37:18] [chat] [rally3]: is well
[23:37:27] [chat] [rally3]: i'd like the design to be close to done at least by december
[23:37:37] [chat] [Odeim]: nice project

[23:37:57] [chat] [rally3]: so theres gonna be a lot of stress, financial aid, etc energy focused on that
[23:38:01] [chat] [rally3]: so its more of a hobby for now
[23:38:14] [chat] [Odeim]: u transfer unis
[23:38:19] [chat] [Odeim]: because the current uni

[16:25:04] [chat] [Odeim]: oi
[16:25:10] [chat] [rally3]: so now essentially it works like this
[16:25:11] [chat] [Odeim]: who is this fela
[16:25:12] [chat] [Odeim]: a bot
[16:25:15] [chat] [rally3]: my laptop
[16:25:17] [connection] 27.4.182.131:62283 requests connection cookie.
[16:25:17] [chat] [Odeim]: ooh

[16:25:19] [join] [Lsrcr]Playa has joined the server (3:27.4.182.131)
[16:25:24] [chat] [rally3]: now it works like this
[16:25:26] [chat] [rally3]: 2 overall scenarios
[16:25:27] [chat] [[Lsrcr]Playa]: sup
[16:25:32] [chat] [Odeim]:  sup playa
[16:25:33] [chat] [rally3]: shooter is car surfing, or shooter is not
[16:25:39] [chat] [rally3]: if shooter is not, damage is as normal
[16:25:46] [chat] [Odeim]:  yeah
[16:25:50] [chat] [rally3]: if he is, then the system takes over
[16:25:59] [chat] [rally3]: now there's 2 scenarios within that that matter
[16:26:03] [chat] [rally3]: 1) hitting a vehicle
[16:26:09] [chat] [rally3]: 2) hitting a player inside a vehicle
[16:26:12] [chat] [[Lsrcr]Playa]: aha
[16:26:14] [chat] [rally3]: 3) hitting a player outside of a vehicle
[16:26:14] [chat] [Odeim]:  wow
[16:26:22] [chat] [rally3]: the only one that works well now, is hitting a player outside a vehicle
[16:26:23] [chat] [Odeim]: i did not think about this at all
[16:26:25] [chat] [Odeim]: you're amazing
[16:26:32] [chat] [[Lsrcr]Playa]: gay
[16:26:33] [chat] [rally3]:  /w 31 
[16:26:35] [chat] [Odeim]: so hitting a player inside a vehicle
[16:26:37] [chat] [rally3]: spam it a bunch to get m4
[16:26:40] [chat] [Odeim]: is not working
[16:26:47] [chat] [rally3]: no, cause of a samp bug
[16:26:50] [chat] [rally3]: but i have a workaround
[16:26:55] [chat] [rally3]: shoot playa's car
[16:26:56] [chat] [rally3]: not him
[16:26:59] [chat] [rally3]: a bit now
[16:27:09] [chat] [[Lsrcr]Playa]: alright
[16:27:11] [chat] [rally3]: see it says hit vehicle while surfing
[16:27:11] [chat] [Odeim]: "hit vehicle while car surfing"
[16:27:12] [chat] [[Lsrcr]Playa]: do you want me to begin
[16:27:15] [chat] [rally3]: try to hit him now
[16:27:16] [chat] [rally3]: dont move
[16:27:27] [chat] [rally3]: see it hits hiim, but it still calls a vehicle_hit
[16:27:32] [chat] [Odeim]: aaaa
[16:27:33] [chat] [rally3]: thats a samp bug known for a long time
[16:27:43] [chat] [rally3]: tried to fix it in their code by reverse engineering it
[16:27:47] [chat] [rally3]: wasted 2 weeks on it, no case
[16:27:49] [chat] [rally3]: so
[16:28:01] [chat] [rally3]: just wanted u to see that, and tell you my "work around" we can try now
[16:28:06] [chat] [rally3]: the workaround will be this
[16:28:20] [chat] [rally3]: once that vehicle_id is detected, onplayerweapon shot will act as normal
[16:28:26] [chat] [rally3]: as in, as u could see now, it will deal damage
[16:28:40] [chat] [rally3]: however, we will detect on our own if that damage was a player or a vehicle itself
[16:28:54] [chat] [rally3]: if it was a vehicle, then before the damage is applied we can give the extra hp to the vehicle
[16:29:00] [chat] [rally3]: so when it gets shot it gets put to the right amount
[16:29:02] [chat] [Odeim]: oooooooof
[16:29:07] [chat] [rally3]: tough to explain, ill do it now and we can test
[16:29:15] [chat] [rally3]: no need to leave the server, upon reset it will log u back in 
[16:29:15] [chat] [[Lsrcr]Playa]: copy that sergeant 
[16:29:15] [chat] [Odeim]: AIGHT LETS DO IT PLAYA
[16:29:16] [chat] [Odeim]: MOVE
[16:29:24] [chat] [[Lsrcr]Playa]: YES SIR
[16:29:26] [chat] [[Lsrcr]Playa]: LETS GO
[16:29:29] [chat] [tester1]: ftw i can still read/talk here so if u need to ttalk talk thru here
[16:29:35] [chat] [[Lsrcr]Playa]: oh lmao
[16:29:43] [chat] [Odeim]: oh fuck i forgot about our little bot
[16:29:47] [chat] [[Lsrcr]Playa]: lmao
[16:30:01] [chat] [Odeim]: but wait
[16:30:05] [chat] [Odeim]: if i shoot playa right now
[16:30:13] [chat] [tester1]: damage now is being passed normally
[16:30:20] [chat] [Odeim]: there is no blood coming out of him lmao
[16:30:21] [chat] [tester1]: since i took out the whole thingy
[16:30:30] [chat] [Odeim]: as if the bullet did not hit him
[16:30:32] [chat] [[Lsrcr]Playa]: 
[16:30:32] [chat] [tester1]: ill show u sth
[16:30:41] [chat] [rally3]: get on my roof odeim
[16:30:47] [chat] [rally3]: try shooting the lap account
[16:30:59] [chat] [rally3]: should say "player damage was"
[16:30:59] [chat] [Odeim]: player damage was
[16:31:01] [chat] [rally3]: or sth right
[16:31:02] [chat] [rally3]: aight cool
[16:31:03] [chat] [Odeim]: yeah
[16:31:11] [chat] [[Lsrcr]Playa]: it didnt say what the damage was though
[16:31:15] [chat] [rally3]: ye ik
[16:31:16] [chat] [Odeim]: DETAILS
[16:31:17] [chat] [rally3]: didnt put that 
[16:31:19] [chat] [rally3]: no need
[16:31:23] [chat] [Odeim]: WE KNOW THAT IT WORKS
[16:31:25] [chat] [rally3]: if i move though
[16:31:44] [chat] [rally3]: it should give it a multiplier
[16:31:47] [chat] [rally3]: lemme check in code sec
[16:31:55] [chat] [Odeim]: a multiplier damage?
[16:32:08] [chat] [rally3]: aight
[16:32:11] [chat] [Odeim]: bitch do u wanna die
[16:32:12] [chat] [rally3]: so while i move the car
[16:32:16] [chat] [[Lsrcr]Playa]: die whore\
[16:32:17] [chat] [rally3]: the damage on the laptop should be less
[16:32:31] [chat] [Odeim]: wow
[16:32:33] [chat] [Odeim]: alot 
[16:32:38] [chat] [rally3]: shoot still now
[16:32:40] [chat] [Odeim]: he didnt take alot damage
[16:32:43] [chat] [rally3]: 100# land if still
[16:32:56] [chat] [rally3]: see
[16:32:59] [chat] [Odeim]: he did not take any damage wtf
[16:33:00] [chat] [rally3]: so that case works fine
[16:33:03] [chat] [Odeim]: so the multipier
[16:33:04] [chat] [Odeim]: is low
[16:33:10] [chat] [rally3]: its proportional to the vehicle speed
[16:33:18] [chat] [rally3]: we had it yesterday with the speed of the car
[16:33:22] [chat] [[Lsrcr]Playa]: thats cool
[16:33:23] [chat] [rally3]: and its mostly b/w [0, 1]
[16:33:40] [chat] [rally3]: and now that i think of it
[16:33:45] [chat] [rally3]: a complication will be that if you hit a player
[16:33:49] [chat] [rally3]: inside a vehicle
[16:33:59] [chat] [rally3]: and we just blindly give a bit more hp to the vehicle
[16:34:03] [chat] [rally3]: it may not be taken out
[16:34:07] [chat] [rally3]: like 
[16:34:10] [chat] [rally3]: ill do it and then we can see 
[16:34:15] [chat] [rally3]: easier to show than talk about it
[16:34:18] [chat] [Odeim]: wait
[16:34:22] [chat] [Odeim]: i understand what u said
[16:34:30] [chat] [Odeim]: but isnt staying inside a car
[16:34:36] [chat] [Odeim]: should reset everything back to normal?
[16:34:42] [chat] [Odeim]: thats what i said,right?
[16:35:11] [chat] [Odeim]: like dont give hp to the vehicle
[16:35:13] [chat] [Odeim]: sec afk
[16:35:40] [chat] [[Lsrcr]Playa]: i got a better idea, just remove car surfind
[16:35:44] [chat] [[Lsrcr]Playa]: surfing*
[16:35:47] [chat] [[Lsrcr]Playa]: problem solved.
[16:35:52] [chat] [[Lsrcr]Playa]: its unrealistic af.
[16:36:30] [chat] [tester1]: i dont know what odeim meant
[16:36:38] [chat] [tester1]: "should reset everything to normal"
[16:36:49] [chat] [[Lsrcr]Playa]: i didnt get that part either
[16:37:01] [chat] [[Lsrcr]Playa]: Honestly what do you think?
[16:37:10] [chat] [[Lsrcr]Playa]: isnt car surfing fucking unrealistic?
[16:37:21] [chat] [Odeim]: no u noob
[16:37:25] [chat] [tester1]: car surfing is enjoyable for some players, but this would make it a bit more realistic
[16:37:31] [chat] [tester1]: and balanced
[16:37:39] [chat] [[Lsrcr]Playa]: i guess
[16:37:46] [chat] [Odeim]: rally,the "multiplier damage" or smth
[16:37:57] [chat] [Odeim]: should not be there when you stay inside the car
[16:38:14] [chat] [[Lsrcr]Playa]: seeyonara
[16:38:18] [kill] [Lsrcr]Playa killed Odeim AK47

[16:52:54] [chat] [Odeim]:  am here
[16:52:55] [chat] [rally3]: now it shouldnt work but a little debug string should come up
[16:52:58] [chat] [rally3]: try again
[16:53:11] [chat] [rally3]: ye its setting ur dmg multiplier
[16:53:16] [chat] [Odeim]: yeah
[16:53:20] [chat] [rally3]: weird
[16:53:22] [chat] [rally3]: let me see
[16:53:25] [chat] [Odeim]: "was set to 0.00"
[16:53:31] [chat] [Odeim]: its giving u armor
[16:53:32] [chat] [Odeim]: lmao
[16:53:52] [chat] [rally3]: i know what it is
[16:53:56] [chat] [rally3]: id 2 is the vehicle
[16:54:02] [chat] [rally3]: taking it as vehicle_hit
[16:54:07] [chat] [rally3]: so its putting it for a vehicle
[16:54:09] [chat] [rally3]: and not my id
[16:54:14] [chat] [Odeim]:  wow
[16:54:18] [chat] [Odeim]:  one little 
[16:54:20] [chat] [Odeim]:  mistake
[16:54:21] [chat] [Odeim]: messes up
[16:54:24] [chat] [rally3]: now how to change it 
[16:54:27] [chat] [Odeim]: the whole dmgmultiplier
[16:54:30] [chat] [rally3]: cause u may be hitting a passenger
[16:54:34] [chat] [rally3]: not necessarily a driver
[16:54:58] [chat] [Odeim]:  ok imma wait for u
[16:55:03] [chat] [rally3]: nah, this may take a while
[16:55:07] [chat] [rally3]: complicated to think of it
[16:55:09] [chat] [rally3]: scenario is this
[16:55:14] [chat] [Odeim]:  so should i leave
[16:55:22] [chat] [rally3]: sure, but i can share the problem
[16:55:29] [chat] [rally3]: the situation is this
[16:55:35] [chat] [rally3]: when u shoot me in a vehicle right now
[16:55:52] [chat] [rally3]: it doesnt pick up my id 
[16:55:54] [chat] [rally3]: as the hitid
[16:55:58] [chat] [rally3]: it picks up the vehicle id
[16:55:58] [chat] [Odeim]:  its picks up
[16:56:00] [chat] [Odeim]: the vehicle id
[16:56:02] [chat] [Odeim]:  right
[16:56:11] [chat] [Odeim]:  it thinks the vehicle
[16:56:13] [chat] [rally3]: the problem with that, is that there's no way to differentiate what player you hit
[16:56:14] [chat] [Odeim]: as a target
[16:56:17] [chat] [Odeim]: instead of u 
[16:56:18] [chat] [rally3]: and theres more than one seat on vehicles
[16:56:28] [chat] [Odeim]:  holy
[16:56:30] [chat] [Odeim]:  is that the problem
[16:56:32] [chat] [rally3]: to implement this well, i'd have to fix the bug within samp itself
[16:56:39] [chat] [rally3]: which is what i wasted 2 weeks on last time
[16:56:44] [chat] [Odeim]:  and probably wont get fixed..
[16:57:01] [chat] [rally3]: oh well
[16:57:06] [chat] [rally3]: was fun while it lasted
[16:57:16] [chat] [Odeim]: shiit wish i know game programming
[16:57:19] [chat] [Odeim]: double the effort
[16:57:22] [chat] [Odeim]: knew*
[16:57:39] [chat] [rally3]: i'll spend some of my free time trying to fix that samp bug
[16:57:44] [chat] [rally3]: but chances are i wont fix it 
[16:57:53] [chat] [rally3]: its related to how gta sa stores a player pointer
[16:57:58] [chat] [rally3]: when u enter a car
[16:58:01] [chat] [Odeim]:  so think about a workaround or something
[16:58:02] [chat] [rally3]:  u know what pointers are right
[16:58:07] [chat] [Odeim]:  hitboxes?
[16:58:08] [chat] [Odeim]:  lmao
[16:58:10] [chat] [Odeim]:  i dunno
[16:58:34] [chat] [rally3]: well its something that points to something else in memory
[16:58:37] [chat] [rally3]: when u enter a car
[16:58:40] [chat] [rally3]: either as vehicle/passenger
[16:58:46] [chat] [rally3]: the pointer points to the vehicle itself
[16:58:50] [chat] [rally3]: and not to your player struct
[16:58:53] [chat] [Odeim]: oooh u talking about "code"
[16:58:55] [chat] [rally3]: yes
[16:59:00] [chat] [rally3]: gta sa 
[16:59:09] [chat] [rally3]: so that was the issue i ran into lass time
[16:59:12] [chat] [rally3]: last time
[16:59:18] [chat] [rally3]: it was always passing the function the samp guys made
[16:59:22] [chat] [Odeim]:  there must be something for it
[16:59:22] [chat] [rally3]: the vehicle pointer
[16:59:24] [chat] [Odeim]: on the internet
[16:59:27] [chat] [rally3]: no lmao
[16:59:32] [chat] [Odeim]:  ._.
[16:59:34] [chat] [rally3]: i was the only one trying to fix it 
[16:59:39] [chat] [rally3]: even in the samp forum discord
[16:59:47] [chat] [rally3]: it was just taken as a common bug and thats it
[16:59:55] [chat] [rally3]: probably for a good reason since its related to gta sa's code 
[17:00:01] [chat] [Odeim]: and nobody even thought about fixing it
[17:00:15] [chat] [Odeim]:  fuk am hungry af
[17:00:18] [chat] [rally3]: well the entire rest of the samp architecture is done around that
[17:00:27] [chat] [rally3]: so it wouldn't work to do soemthing too drastic
[17:00:35] [chat] [rally3]: so i think this idea, although interesting
[17:00:38] [chat] [rally3]: wouldn't really work
[17:00:42] [chat] [rally3]:  r i p
[17:00:47] [chat] [Odeim]:  rip idea
[17:00:52] [chat] [Odeim]:  actually
[17:00:54] [chat] [rally3]: well u know a suggestion that would
[17:00:56] [chat] [Odeim]:  i hopped in cb server
[17:00:57] [chat] [rally3]: work
[17:01:00] [chat] [Odeim]:  they implemented it very well
[17:01:10] [chat] [rally3]: the decreased aim one?
[17:01:14] [chat] [Odeim]:  yeah
[17:01:20] [chat] [rally3]: how u know it was implemented
[17:01:34] [chat] [Odeim]: i was teaming with cops
[17:01:37] [chat] [Odeim]: i was standing
[17:01:42] [chat] [Odeim]: car surfing
[17:01:44] [chat] [Odeim]: it says
[17:01:53] [chat] [rally3]: wanna join in their server and show me?
[17:01:57] [chat] [Odeim]: "weapon aim accuracy will get deacreased"
[17:02:07] [chat] [rally3]: well thats just a message lmao
[17:02:12] [chat] [rally3]: i can print that now and still do nothing
[17:02:19] [chat] [Odeim]:  but i think it works
[17:02:25] [chat] [rally3]: wanna test it over there?
[17:02:26] [chat] [Odeim]:  right now they reset everything
[17:02:31] [chat] [Odeim]:  i dont have weapons
[17:02:34] [chat] [Odeim]: as a cop
[17:02:39] [chat] [rally3]: wym
[17:02:46] [chat] [Odeim]:  they did an update
[17:02:49] [chat] [Odeim]: like "life reset
[17:02:53] [chat] [rally3]: oh
